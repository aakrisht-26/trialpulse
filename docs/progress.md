## Step 1: Repo skeleton, tooling, CI

Date: 2026-09-23. Status: approved by Aakrisht on 2026-09-23 (Docker Postgres check pending on his machine).

### What was built

- uv project on Python 3.12, src layout, typed package `trialpulse`, build backend `uv_build`.
- `src/trialpulse/config.py`: `load_project_config()` reads `config/project.yaml` into a frozen, strictly validated `ProjectConfig` that environment variables cannot override. `Secrets` reads credentials from the environment or `.env` as `SecretStr` (ADR 0002).
- `config/project.yaml` with every tunable constant from CLAUDE.md Section 6. `dataset.revision` and `dataset.cutoff` are `null` until Step 2.
- `tests/test_config.py`: 17 tests, including the smoke test that loads the committed config and checks it against Section 6.
- pre-commit: end-of-file-fixer, trailing-whitespace, check-added-large-files, and ruff check, ruff format and mypy as local `uv run` hooks (ADR 0003).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: on push and pull request, runs `uv sync --locked`, ruff check, ruff format check, mypy on src, and pytest with coverage.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Postgres 16 with a `pg_isready` healthcheck, bound to 127.0.0.1.
- `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, README stub with the required disclaimer, MIT LICENSE (Aakrisht Yadav, 2026).
- Docs: this file, `interview_notes.md`, ADRs 0001 to 0003, and the `preregistration.md` header.

### Acceptance criteria

Evidence below is from Claude's shell on 2026-09-23. It is not a claim about Aakrisht's machine; the verify commands are the check.

| Criterion | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Lint clean | `ruff check .`: All checks passed |
| Format clean | `ruff format --check .`: 11 files already formatted (ruff 0.16 also checks Markdown) |
| Types clean | `mypy src` (strict): no issues in 2 source files |
| Tests clean, smoke test loads the config | `pytest -q`: 17 passed; `config.py` at 100% line and branch coverage |
| Postgres container healthy | **Not verified by Claude.** Docker is not installed or not on PATH in Claude's shell. |
| pre-commit passes on all files | `pre-commit run --all-files`: all 6 hooks passed, no files modified |
| Public GitHub repo exists and CI is green | https://github.com/aakrisht-26/trialpulse created; CI run 35792432458 on `b7c2a96` passed (lint, format, types, 17 tests, CPython 3.12.3 on ubuntu-latest) |

### Decisions

Approved by Aakrisht on 2026-09-23:

- PyYAML through `pydantic-settings[yaml]` for YAML parsing (ADR 0002).
- ruff and mypy as local pre-commit hooks through `uv run` (ADR 0003).
- Create the public repository `aakrisht-26/trialpulse` and push `main`.
- Repo-local git identity: Aakrisht Yadav with the GitHub noreply email.

Made by Claude, flagged for review:

- Only Step 1 dependencies were added (pydantic, pydantic-settings[yaml]; dev: ruff, mypy, pytest, pytest-cov, pre-commit). The rest of the locked stack is added by the step that first uses it, so each addition is reviewed in context.
- `project.yaml` also records the status groups, stop-reason groups, calibration bins (10) and lift fraction (0.10), because they are Section 6 constants. The default seed is 42.
- `.python-version` (3.12) and `src/trialpulse/py.typed` were added. Neither is in the Section 16 layout, but both are standard for a typed uv package.
- Ruff rule set: E, W, F, I, B, UP, SIM, C4, N, PT, PTH, RUF, with line length 100.
- CI: third-party actions pinned to commit SHAs, uv pinned to 0.11.26, a read-only token, `persist-credentials: false`, and cancellation of superseded runs. Coverage is reported but has no threshold.
- Docker Compose uses fixed local-only credentials (`trialpulse`), the Debian `postgres:16` image (glibc collation, like Neon) and a named volume.
- `.env.example` has comments, including the local Compose connection URL, which is not a secret.
- The pre-commit git hook is installed in `.git/hooks`.

### Blocked, skipped or deferred

- The Postgres health check (`docker compose up -d`, `docker compose ps`) could not be run by Claude. Aakrisht runs it.
- The dataset revision and cutoff are deferred to Step 2, by design.
- Note for Step 8: `docs/preregistration.md` exists in git history from Step 1 as a header stub. The test lock must require a substantive registration (for example, the status line changed and hypotheses present), not just any committed version of the file. (Resolved by ADR 0004 on 2026-09-23.)
- CI annotation: GitHub will move `ubuntu-latest` to Ubuntu 26 starting 2026-10-19. The workflow still uses `ubuntu-latest`. Pinning `ubuntu-24.04` is an option for review; nothing was changed. (Resolved: pinned to ubuntu-24.04 on 2026-09-23.)
- Local note: uv warns that it cannot hardlink from its cache (on C:) into the project (on E:) and falls back to copying. This is harmless. `$env:UV_LINK_MODE = "copy"` silences it.

## Overnight run (2026-09-23)

One line per finished item. On resume, continue after the last line.

- [x] Follow-up 1: CI pinned to ubuntu-24.04; runs on main are never cancelled (commit: chore: pin CI runner).
- [x] Follow-up 2: ADR 0004 (test lock via annotated prereg-v1 tag) written (commit: docs: add ADR 0004).
- [x] Step 2 code: spike parts a to h (feasibility package) with 54 tests on synthetic fixtures; parts a to c ran and are blocked (dataset access pending author approval) (commit: feat(step2): add feasibility spike).
